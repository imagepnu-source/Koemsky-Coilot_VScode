# UI Design Editor — local repo

Repository for iterative refactor of UIDesignDialog / ui-design helpers.

Workflow:
- Work on branch `ui-design-refactor`.
- Run typecheck frequently: `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Use `document.getElementById('ui-design-vars')` and console logs for runtime verification.

Commit often and keep popup behavior intact; avoid changing popup markup in big sweeps.
